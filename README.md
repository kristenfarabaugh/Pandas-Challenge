# Pandas-Challenge

## Summary of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover insights that will enable the school board and mayor to make strategic, future state decision around school budgets and priorities. Using Python and PANDAS, we've sliced, diced, analyzed, grouped and created summary views to uncover key trends within the available data.

## Key Findings:
1. Charter schools outperform District schools across the board (based on the following metrics: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % of Students Passing Math, % of Students Passing Reading, and % of students passing overall). Further analysis is required to understand the "why" - several factors can be linked to the lower scores. One example is total student population - Charter schools have significantly less #s of students, which could lead to 1) a lower teacher:student ratio and 2) more time spent on individual students questions (thus increasing a student's understanding of content, resulting in high test / pass rates).
2. Larger, total school budgets and budgets per student does not seem to increase performance (based on the following metrics: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % of Students Passing Math, % of Students Passing Reading, and % of students passing overall). Schools with higher total school budgets and high budget per students did not perform better than those with lower budgets (in totality or per head).
